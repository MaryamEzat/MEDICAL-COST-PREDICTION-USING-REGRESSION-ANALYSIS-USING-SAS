# **Medical Cost Prediction using Regression Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using **Regression Analysis** on the **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**. The dataset includes **demographic and health-related factors** such as **age, BMI, smoking status, and region**, which influence insurance charges.

## **Technologies Used**
- **SAS** for data preprocessing, regression modeling, and evaluation.
- **Python** for additional analysis and reporting.
- **Scikit-learn & Matplotlib** for visualization and evaluation.

## **Key Features**
✔ **Data Preprocessing** - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.  
✔ **Feature Engineering** - Identified key predictors (**smoking status, BMI, and age**) that influence insurance costs.  
✔ **Model Training** - Built a **Linear Regression Model** to predict medical charges.  
✔ **Model Evaluation** - Achieved **73% R-squared** with **MAE: $4,200** and **RMSE: $5,700**.  
✔ **Visualizations** - Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to analyze feature impact.

## **Results & Conclusion**
- **Smoking status** has the most significant impact on medical costs.
- **BMI and age** are strong predictors of insurance charges.
- The regression model provides **reliable predictions**, with potential improvements using **advanced models** like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
